# Feature Specification: Manage Git feature worktrees

**Feature Branch**: `[001-build-a-tool]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a tool to manage Git worktrees for feature-based development: enable quick creation of feature-specific worktrees from a chosen base, list and switch between worktrees, enforce clear naming to avoid collisions, and support safe cleanup of completed worktrees. Focus narrowly on worktree lifecycle and navigation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working across multiple features, I want to create isolated Git worktrees per feature, list and switch between them, and safely clean them up when finished so that I can work in parallel without polluting my main repository workspace.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing worktree for a requested feature, **When** a developer requests creation from a specified base, **Then** a uniquely named feature worktree is created and made active.
2. **Given** multiple worktrees exist, **When** a developer requests a list of worktrees, **Then** the system returns each worktree's name, source/base reference, and whether it is currently active.
3. **Given** a feature worktree exists, **When** a developer switches to it, **Then** the active working copy becomes that worktree without modifying other worktrees.
4. **Given** a finished worktree, **When** a developer requests safe cleanup, **Then** the worktree is removed without unintended data loss, the branch is kept by default, and branch deletion is allowed only with explicit opt-in and only if fully merged into a specified base.
5. **Given** a worktree has uncommitted changes, **When** a developer switches away to another worktree, **Then** switching proceeds and a clear warning summarizes the dirty state.
6. **Given** a worktree has uncommitted changes or untracked/ignored files, **When** a developer requests removal, **Then** removal is blocked by default; explicit force is allowed only for untracked/ignored files; removal is never allowed if there are unpushed commits or an operation (e.g., rebase/merge/cherry-pick) in progress.

### Edge Cases
- Base reference does not exist or is unreachable.
- Duplicate or invalid feature name: prevent collisions and guide the user to choose a different name.
- Existing branch without a corresponding worktree: on create, reuse the existing branch for the new worktree; no new branch is required.
- Attempt to remove the currently active worktree: disallow and guide the user.
- Worktree directory manually moved or deleted outside the tool: detect and reconcile or offer cleanup.
- Large repositories with many worktrees: provide filtering or paging for listing. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected scale and limits]
- Base reference exists only on remote and is not fetched locally: auto-fetch the base; on fetch failure, abort with clear guidance.
- Branch already checked out in another worktree: disallow duplicate checkout; offer selecting the existing worktree or creating a sibling branch via explicit opt-in.
- Pre-existing local branch name conflicts with requested feature name (different base): decide whether to reuse or error. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Target worktree path already exists or is non-empty: prevent creation and guide to a new path/name.
- Worktree path contains spaces or special characters: ensure operations handle quoting safely.
- Case-insensitive filesystem collisions (e.g., macOS): treat names differing only by case as duplicates.
- Dirty worktree handling: switching away is allowed with a warning; removal is blocked if tracked changes are present and blocked by default for untracked/ignored files unless explicitly forced; removal is never allowed if there are unpushed commits/no upstream or an operation in progress.
- Command executed outside a Git repository or inside a nested repository: detect repository root and prevent misuse with clear messaging.
- Stale worktree metadata after manual filesystem changes: offer pruning or repair.
- Environment lacks required Git features/version for worktrees: detect and inform with remediation steps.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow developers to create isolated feature worktrees from a specified base reference.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST list existing worktrees for the current repository with name, base reference, and active status.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST switch the active working copy to a selected worktree on request.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST safely remove a finished worktree without unintended data loss; keep the branch by default, and allow branch deletion only with explicit opt-in and only if fully merged into a specified base.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST enforce this naming convention and uniqueness:
   - Format: NNN-kebab-feature
   - Charset: lowercase [a-z0-9-]
   - Length: feature segment ‚â§ 40 characters
   - Uniqueness: case-insensitive unique across existing worktrees
   - Reserved names disallowed: 'main', 'master'
- **FR-006**: The system MUST validate preconditions (e.g., base reference existence, clean state) and provide actionable feedback, including auto-fetching a remote-only base before creation and aborting with clear guidance on failure.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST present clear status of the current worktree (name, base reference, path).
- **FR-008**: The system MUST select a default base when none is provided: use the repository's default branch (remote HEAD) when available; else use 'main' if it exists; else use 'master'. The chosen base MUST be displayed and always overrideable via flag/config.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST handle invalid or conflicting operations with informative messages (e.g., cannot remove active worktree).
- **FR-010**: The system MUST default to a global hidden worktrees root under the user's workspace (kept separate from primary repositories) and MUST allow override via flag and config. The chosen location MUST be displayed.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST enforce conservative dirty-state policies: allow switching between worktrees even if the current worktree is dirty (with a visible warning); block removal if tracked changes are present or an operation is in progress; block removal if the branch has unpushed commits or no upstream; allow explicit force solely to delete untracked/ignored files.
- **FR-012**: The system SHOULD provide responsive UX for common operations (create, list, switch); specific performance targets are deferred until post-MVP metrics are collected.
 - **FR-013**: When a requested branch is already checked out in another worktree, the system MUST disallow duplicate checkout and offer either selecting the existing worktree or creating a sibling branch via explicit opt-in.
 - **FR-014**: When creating a worktree and a local branch with the requested name exists and is not checked out in any worktree, the system MUST reuse that branch rather than creating a new branch.
 - **FR-015**: For v1, the system MUST expose a command-line interface. Non-CLI interfaces are out of scope.
 - **FR-016**: For v1, the system MUST operate only on the current Git repository; cross-repository scanning or actions are out of scope.

*Ambiguities to resolve:*
- Cleanup semantics are [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: whether to delete associated tags]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feature Worktree**: An isolated working copy tied to a specific feature branch; created from a base reference.
- **Base Reference**: The source branch or commit from which a feature worktree is created.
- **Feature Name**: The human-readable label used to name and identify a worktree.
- **Repository**: The Git project within which feature worktrees are managed.
