# Archived Bash Implementation

This directory contains the original bash implementation of the worktrees tool that was developed during the exploration phase.

## Contents

- `bash-implementation/` - The original bash source code
- `bash-tests/` - The original bash test suite (bats-based)

## Why Archived

The bash implementation was successful in exploring the problem space and validating the core concepts, but ultimately proved challenging to maintain and test properly. The Ruby implementation in the main project provides:

- Better error handling and structured exceptions
- More robust testing with RSpec + Aruba
- Cleaner dependency management with Bundler
- Natural CLI patterns with dry-cli

## Historical Value

This bash implementation documents the learning process and validates that the core git worktree operations work correctly. The exploration led to the final Ruby implementation that follows personal development principles.
